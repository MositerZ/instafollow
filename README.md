# Instafollow  
> Instafollow is a fully automated Instagram bot to follow and later unfollow specified users from an authenticated user's account.  
### Usage  
> Instafollow runs best when it is open in multiple terminal tabs. The approximate number of target accounts hit per hour can be reached by multiplying the amount of open tabs by **12**. Due to the *160* requests limit moderately enforced by Instagram, I recommend having a maximum of **15** tabs running Instafollow at once. This would result in a rough maximum of **180** accounts reached per hour.   
### Tips    
> Instafollow will not run when a computer is off. Make sure your machine is plugged in and does not go to sleep while running the program.  I also suggest using the *15* second break after each unfollow to quit your program. This will prohibit the build up of unknown followed users.
