# Instafollow  
> Instafollow is a fully automated Instagram bot to follow and later unfollow specified users from an authenticated user's account.  
  
### Tips  
> Instafollow will not run when a computer is off. Make sure your machine is plugged in and does not go to sleep while running the program.  
> Use the *15* second break after each unfollow to quit your program. This will prohibit the build up of unknown followed users.
  
### Statistics  
> The approximate number of accounts reached per hour can be reached by multiplying the amount of open tabs by **9**. This incorporates the five minute break as well as the fifteen second delay before following the next user. Due to the *160* request limit, I recommend having a maximum of **16** tabs opened at once.
